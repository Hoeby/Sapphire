## Making gantry
Needed for these steps: <br>
- 6x  BHCS m3x6mm screw <br>
- 6x SHDC m3x20mm screw <br>
- 16x BHCS m5x10mm screw <br>
- 2x  SHDC m6x20mm screw <br>
- 16x T-nut, spring loaded type for 20 series - M5 <br>
- 6x Threaded inserts M3x5 <br>
- 3x IGUS eglm05 (cheaper option: GE5C bearing) <br>
- 1x 2020 profile 316,0mm long <br>
- 2x 2020 profile 225,0mm long <br>
- 1x 2020 profile 189,0mm long <br>


Start with making M6 thread on both sides of the 316mm profile, +/- 20mm deep.

Assemble the parts, that it looks like this picture. <br>
These are the sizes for mounting a bed which has hole spacing 209x209mm. <br>
If you have hole spacing 170x170mm, then the 189,0mm profile has to be changed to 150,0mm long. <br>
The brackets shown, are the minimum brackets which needs to be mounted. <br>

Prep the 3d parts, which needs to be mounted to the sides of the 316mm profile. <br>
Start with placing the threaded inserts in the bottom of the main part. Take your time doing this, the wall is thin. <br>
After that place the top plate on the main part with 3x M3x20mm. <br>
Place the IGUS eglm05 in it hole and secure it with 3x m3x6, be carefull with these screws, they tap there on thread when mounting. <br>
Align the assebled part on the profile and start with the M6x20 screw on the side. Do not fully tighten. <br>
Place the spring loaded M5 nuts and M5 screws in place. Align everything to the profile and tighten the screws. <br>

The 316mm profile is on the save side, that the length had the be a little longer. <br>
Therefor there are 2020 profile spacers in the .stl folder. How much needed depends on your printer. <br>
