## Mounting stepper motors

Mounting the steppers can be a little tricky. <br>
I made the holes for the thrust bearing pretty small. That the axis mounting ring doesn't fit tru this hole. <br>
This was because i didn't want to make that large holes in the base. <br>

Start by putting the filler plate on the stepper. <br>

Place the stepper + filler plate in the correct position. <br>

The next pictures are a little confusion, because the z-stepper plate is already mounted, but don't do that.<br><br>
After placing the stepper in the correct position, first put the thrust bearing in place. <br>

Next, place the axis mounting ring in place. <br>
Push i good against the stepper and secure the axis mounting ring in place <br>
When everything is in place, mount fit the z-stepper plate over it and secure everything together with M3x16mm screws. <br>
Repeat these steps for the other stepper motors. <br>
