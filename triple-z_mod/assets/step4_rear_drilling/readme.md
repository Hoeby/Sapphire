## Rear profile position, drilling the holes in the base
Only do these steps, if you are sure the aligment is perfect. <br>

For the mounting the profile for the back extrusion, there is a drill jig made. <br>
This drill jig fits on the originale stepper holes. Only 1 hole in the base needs to be drilled for this step. <br>
Enlarge the hole to 6mm <br>
