# Sapphire SP3 triple-z mod

## Front left and right new parts, check before drilling

These steps are for the front left and front right. The new extrusion on the back will follow later. <br>
First start to mount the new MGN9H 300mm rails.<br>
For each rail you need: <br>
8x SHDC m3x8mm screw <br>
8x T-nut, spring loaded type for 20 series - M3 <br>
<br>
To align them, i used an align tool.<br>
Search on internet for a tool you like, for example: <a href="https://www.yeggi.com/q/mgn9+alignment/">Align MGN9H tool</a>

To mount the rail on the correct height, place correct z-stepper plate undernead. <br>
Keep aprox 1mm space between rail and z-stepper plate.

To check if everything is aligned, mount the z-carriage to the MGN9H.<br>
There is a round drill jig, place this jig in the z-stepper plate.<br>
If everything is correctly aligned, the small hole of the jig is in the middle of the space where the spindle will be mounted.<br>
If this is not the case, check you alignement, don't drill before this is solved.
