# Sapphire SP3 triple-z mod

## Align extrusion profiles that they are square
Needed for these steps: <br>
- aluminium tape <br>
- patience <br>

The base of the sapphire sp3 is a welded base. <br>
On my sp3 i noticed, that the extrusion profiles where not square to each other.

To make them square, i used aluminium tape. Just stick it on to rotate or tilt the extrusion profile, untill everything is square to each other

When everything is square, do another check, put a profile between the profile and see if it touches both profiles correctly. <br>
Like shown in the red cirkel, the 2 arrows. If everything is square, there where to arrows are, there isn't shining light between. <br>
If the test profile if not flush and there is light shining between the profiles, re-adjust everything.
