# Sapphire SP3 triple-z mod

## Drilling the holes in the base
Only do these steps, if you are sure the aligment is perfect. <br>

Start drilling the holes. Use the z-stepper plates as a jig. <br>
Drill only the 2 holes that are closed to the screen side. <br>

When the first 2 holes are done, place some screws in the holes, that the z-stepper plate will not move. <br>
Remove the z-carriage and drill use the jig to drill the hole for the spindle. <br>

The hole for the spindle has to be enlarged, that a thrust bearing can go tru the hole. <br>
On mine i made them 20mm diameter. <br>
This is how it looks, when all hole for the front steppes are done (1 side shown)

For the mounting the profile for the back extrusion, there is a drill jig made. <br>
This drill jig fits on the originale stepper holes. <br>
